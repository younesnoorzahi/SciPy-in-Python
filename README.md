<h2>SciPy in Python</h2>
<p>SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is a fundamental Python library for scientific computing and technical computing. It builds on NumPy and provides a large number of higher-level functions that operate on NumPy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.</p>

<h2>Key Features of SciPy</h2>
<br>
<span>1. Built on NumPy: SciPy uses NumPy arrays as its basic data structure</span>
<br>
<span>2. Efficient implementations: Many algorithms are implemented in optimized C and Fortran code
</span>
<br>
<span>3. Open-source: Free to use with a BSD license</span>
<br>
<span>4. Extensive functionality: Covers many scientific computing domains</span>
